# DiskBlocks

DiskBlocks is a visual storage usage analyzer for Windows. It displays storage usage in the analysis pane in directory order. The visualizer is reactive, and each directory can be clicked for more information, and to view subdirectories or files within it.

## Getting Started

DiskBlocks can be compiled simply by using mingw-w64.

Steps:
1. Install [mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
2. Run the build script **build_mingw.bat**
3. Run the DiskBlocks executable at /Output/DiskBlocks.exe

## Usage

To use DiskBlocks, first enter a path to a directory. Alternatively, press the drive letter button, and select it from the file tree. Then, press "Begin Scan."
In the analysis pane, a directory or file can be selected for more information. If a directory is selected, child directories will be shown.
